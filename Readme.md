# NextJS vs NuxtJS

For a while now I've been thinking to learn a bit about VueJS - it's comes after ReactJS and AngularJS as the new hype. But I didn't want to spend too much time figuring out how to do the routing, the webpack configuration and so on. Since I am using NextJS for a while now, I thought giving a try to NuxtJS, which is basically the same thing just .. it's for VueJS and not for ReactJS.

Here what you see are the initial setup of both of these frameworks so you can see the difference after running the first lines of 'getting started'

* for Nuxt application:  ```npx create-nuxt-app```
* for React application: ```npx create-next-app```

I wrote an article about my opinion trying Nuxt on [Medium](https://medium.com/@daniel.pacurici/next-vs-nuxt-87aa957d5967?sk=501e2a16dc63d5e798692a1087ff154e). Feel free to leave a comment and enjoy coding! :wink:

Thank you! :smiley:
